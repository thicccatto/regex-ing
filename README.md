# regex-ing
Common Compiled Regular Expressions to use.
# Get Started
All RegEx is under the text file found in the repo.
# MATCHING
All regex uses text to match. EG the input "abc"
without quotes would match all consecutive abc characters in a string. Note this is case sensitive.

# CHARACTER SETS
Using square brackets "[]" tells RegEx to match any character in a set. EG. with the input [abc], it would match any a, b or c character anywhere.

# WILDCARDS
Using the character ".", tells to look for any character. This can be used to say, after x find the next character. Alternativly, to actually match the "." character, you must use the escape function which is "\". EG abc. would match 1 character after and including abc, while abc\. would match "abc."
